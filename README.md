# Dawn - A small project of mine

This is just a weird thought that pops inside my brain. "What if I make a game?" And so, I made this. It starts as a simple do-while condition in C++, and it became this, apparently. And okay, enough yapping.

And this is my first project made using Visual Studio (Community 2026.)

## Features

- This game is still in development. What do you expect?
- .ini files as settings, maybe? (Is that a flex?)

## TO DOs

- [ ] Add a RPG-ish gameplay
- [ ] More features
- [ ] MAYBE, just MAYBE, make the game visually using anything else I can do. But unfortunately, I don't understand anything about 3D game development. Not even Godot or Roblox Studio.

## Version changelogs

### Version 0.0.1 Alpha

The very first "update." Which adds the bare bones of this so-calld "Game."
